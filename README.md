# Small-Lisp-Programs
Spring 2016

These are some small Lisp programs done for my Principles of Programming course at MSU Denver which helped me become more familiar with Lisp and the functional programming paradigm. Each one comes with documentation as to what the program is supposed to accomplish as well as tests to ensure the program is performing correctly.
